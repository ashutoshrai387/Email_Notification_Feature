# Email Notification Feature Proof of Concept (POC)

## Objective
To create a proof of concept (POC) for an email notification feature within an application, enabling it to send automated emails to users under specified conditions (e.g., registration confirmation, password reset).

## Background
Email notifications are a critical component of user engagement and communication strategy in web applications. This feature should demonstrate the capability to dynamically generate and send emails to users based on specific triggers within the application.

## Requirements
- Research and select an email delivery service or SMTP server (e.g., SendGrid, Amazon SES, SMTP).
- Implement a mechanism to trigger email notifications under predefined conditions.
- Ensure the solution supports dynamic content in emails, such as personalized user information.
- Design email templates for at least two scenarios (e.g., welcome email, password reset).
- Implement proper error handling and logging for email delivery status.

## Resources
- Documentation for the chosen email delivery service or SMTP server.
- Access to development tools and libraries necessary for email integration.

## Task Breakdown

### 1. Research and Setup
- Evaluate different email delivery services or SMTP servers to find the most appropriate for the project's needs.
- Set up an account with the selected service and configure it for use in the project

### 2. Email Trigger Mechanism Development
- Develop the logic to trigger emails based on specific application events (e.g., new user registration, request for password reset).
- Integrate the trigger mechanism with the email delivery service's API or SMTP server.

### 3. Email Content and Template Creation
- Design and create email templates for different notification scenarios, ensuring they are responsive and user-friendly.
- Implement functionality to dynamically populate the templates with content specific to each user and scenario.

### 4. Testing and Validation
- Test the email notification feature thoroughly to ensure reliability and accuracy in various scenarios.
- Validate the responsiveness and appearance of email templates across different email clients and devices.
  
### 5. Documentation
- Document the configuration process for the email delivery service or SMTP server.
- Provide detailed instructions on how to create and modify email templates.
- Outline the process for integrating new triggers for email notifications.

### 6. Presentation
- Prepare a demonstration of the email notification feature, showing the trigger mechanism and the received emails for different scenarios.
- Highlight any challenges encountered during the development process and how they were addressed.

## Deliverables
- Source code for the email notification feature.
- Email templates for different notification scenarios.
- Documentation on the setup, configuration, and usage of the feature.
- Live demonstration of the feature to the project team.

## Deadline
5 days

## Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality: The feature reliably sends emails in response to the specified triggers.
- Scalability: The solution can handle a growing volume of emails as the application scales.
- Code Quality: The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
- Documentation: The documentation is comprehensive, clear, and helpful for future development and maintenance.
- Presentation: The demonstration effectively showcases the feature and its benefits.
