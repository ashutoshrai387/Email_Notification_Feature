# Email Notification Feature Proof of Concept (POC)

## Objective
The aim of this project is to develop a proof of concept (POC) for an email notification feature within an application. This feature will enable automated email notifications to be sent to users based on specific triggers, such as registration confirmation or password reset requests.

## Background
Email notifications are essential for user engagement and communication in web applications. This POC intends to showcase the capability of dynamically generating and dispatching emails to users based on predefined conditions within the application.

## Requirements
- Research and select an email delivery service or SMTP server.
- Implement a mechanism to trigger email notifications under predefined conditions.
- Ensure support for dynamic content in emails, including personalized user information.
- Design email templates for various scenarios (e.g., welcome email, password reset).
- Implement robust error handling and logging for email delivery status tracking.

## Resources
- Documentation for the chosen email delivery service or SMTP server.
- Access to development tools and libraries required for email integration.

## Task Breakdown

### 1. Research and Setup
- Evaluate different email delivery services or SMTP servers.
- Set up an account with the selected service and configure it for project use.

### 2. Email Trigger Mechanism Development
- Develop logic to trigger emails based on specific application events.
- Integrate the trigger mechanism with the chosen email delivery service's API or SMTP server.

### 3. Email Content and Template Creation
- Design email templates for different notification scenarios.
- Implement functionality to dynamically populate templates with user-specific content.

### 4. Testing and Validation
- Conduct comprehensive testing of the email notification feature to ensure reliability and accuracy.
- Validate email template responsiveness and appearance across various email clients and devices.

### 5. Documentation
- Document the configuration process for the email delivery service or SMTP server.
- Provide detailed instructions for creating and modifying email templates.
- Outline the process for integrating new triggers for email notifications.

### 6. Presentation
- Prepare a demonstration showcasing the email notification feature, including trigger mechanism functionality and sample email notifications.
- Address any challenges encountered during development and their resolutions.

## Deliverables
- Source code for the email notification feature.
- Email templates for different notification scenarios.
- Documentation detailing setup, configuration, and usage of the feature.
- Live demonstration of the feature to the project team.

## Deadline
5 days
